1) g calender compatible

2) category of events. multi events support like (bday + imp)

3) asynchronous calls to g calendar

4) background sync

5) push local reminders to global (g calender)

6) delete reminders

7) bulk add reminders with x preset. and y is new stuff. finally create reminders with x + y 

8) ability to find out my free time with seeing my calendar schedule.
9) default input is add reminder.

10) supported formats:
        space or without space/hrs + hr + h + hours + hour / min + mins + m + minutes + minute/ sec + seconds + s 
        test against 10h40 / 40m11h...
        make sure only one hr, sec, min is there # try to do this later...ig use regex and see if there r more than 1 match for yr in a string


11) really flexible with opening / closing it

12) maybe an option to launch su/an within in?
        a save and launch feature...call the saver function and push the command to console...
        + learn about how python programs r recognised terminal cmds , ex: yt-dlp
                add rm command that u can access from terminal 

13) before trying google calender api , first see how the notification integration with termux or maybe with gcalender itself to send temporary notification(though this isnt offline) is going to work...any offline android api? also check effecient ways to integrate *time drain* in android instead of await sleep(400days)...is tasker integration possible? or good enough?
14) we can validate user input in this and other,programs with regex..[\d\w]+
        for better error handling! + input validation
15) try:
        import curses
        to see the width of devicee to structure the text...if module not found(windows) then default to basic way... 
16) add rm support for windows as well...like tasker does it for android
17) how hard is it just to make an apk which handles the intents and then sends a notif at the specified time..
